Informations:
tammoOS based on Ubuntu 18.04 at 32Bit and Ubuntu 24.04 at 64Bit
This OS contains 3 Operating Systems. (macOS Ubuntu and Windows)

Hardware Support and requiments:
I tested Version 1.0 and 1.1 on an Intel Core 2 Duo and Intel Atom with 2 Gigs of Ram. These 2 Versions working fine on old PCs.
tammoOS version 2.0 is only supported for 64Bit PCs. I tested this Version on an HP Pavilion Laptop from 2013 with 4 Gigs of Ram and it work pretty good.
At least you need 2 Gigs of Ram for the 32 Bit Version and 4 Gigs of Ram for the 64 Bit Version for a good performance.
